# Rice-Type-Classification

The goal of this project is to use convolutional network architectures to assist with training and predicting five different types of rice. This report aims to show the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and to compare them against other architectures such as the multiple layer perceptron. Furthermore, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of using CNN architecture which can be used on more complex data to assist industries such as agriculture through deep learning architecture in efficient identification of various product types.

The dataset used is "Rice Image Dataset" by Murat Koklu, it is found on Kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset/code?datasetId=2049052&sortBy=voteCount
